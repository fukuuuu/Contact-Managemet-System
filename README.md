# Contact-Managemet-System
    This project is similar to contact managing in cell phones but presenting in the console. The application records, modifies, searches, views and removes data: contacts in a file, using pointers, functions, data structures and file handling.
    The program prompts the users th choose choices which are; 1) Add a new contact, 2) List all contacts, 3) Search for a contact, 4) Edit a contact, 5) Delete a contact and 0) Exit the program. The informations needed to be filled the users choose 1) Add a new contact are name, phone, address, email address. The users can exit the program after adding an ew contact by filling in the Name with some character that is not relatable; I have not decided it yet. After that the program goes back to the menu that I mentioned above where the users can choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 0, and so on.
